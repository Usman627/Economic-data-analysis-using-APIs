# Economic-data-analysis-using-APIs
This project uses data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API to analyze and visualize unemployment and labor force participation rates for each US state. 
The data is collected from FRED and analyzed using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and requests.

The first step in the project involves retrieving data for the variables of interest (unemployment rate and labor force participation rate) from FRED using the API. 
Once the data is retrieved, it is cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.

Next, the data is visualized using matplotlib to create individual plots for unemployment rate and labor force participation rate for each US state. 
These plots are then used to compare the trends and patterns of these variables across different states.

Finally, subplots are created to compare the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate for each state side-by-side. 
This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the data and helps to identify any relationships or correlations between the two variables.

Overall, this project provides a detailed analysis of the unemployment and labor force participation rates for each US state using data from FRED and Python libraries.
